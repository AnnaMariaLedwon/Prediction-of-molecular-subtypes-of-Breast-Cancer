### Data information
This data set contains published iTRAQ proteome profiling of 77 breast cancer samples generated by the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (NCI/NIH). It contains expression values for ~12.000 proteins for each sample, with missing values present when a given protein could not be quantified in a given sample.

The data set consists of:
* **77cancerproteomesCPTACitraq.csv** : The decription of quantitative mass-spectrometry-based proteomic and phosphoproteomic analyses of 105 genomically annotated breast cancers, of which 77 provided high-quality data. More information here: https://www.nature.com/articles/nature18003
* **clinicaldatabreast_cancer.csv** :  The data about the cancer classification of a given sample using different methods. For me it was important "mRNA.PAM50" method, which I used as a training and testing data set in the Machine Learning models.
* **PAM50_proteins.csv** : The list of genes and proteins used by the PAM50 classification system.

### About project ...
Using lasso regression, 50 proteins were selected to train and test machine learning models to classify and predict the molecular subtype of breast cancer. Three models were built, namely the support vector machine, random forest and artificial neural networks. In addition, the prediction using PAM50 proteins was checked on the same classification models. It turned out that the models based on protein generated by lasso regressions performed better during the evaluation.
